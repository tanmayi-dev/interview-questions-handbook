#### What is slug

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

A "slug" is a web development term that refers to a human-readable URL fragment used to identify a resource or a page on a website. Slugs are typically used in URLs to make them more descriptive and user-friendly, as they often include words that describe the content of the page.

For example, consider the URL of a blog post:

Original URL: https://example.com/blog/article?id=123

URL with Slug: https://example.com/blog/article/my-interesting-blog-post

In this example, "my-interesting-blog-post" is the slug. It provides a clear indication of the content of the page, making the URL more meaningful to both users and search engines.

Slugs are commonly used in content management systems (CMS) and blogging platforms to automatically generate URLs for posts, articles, products, and other resources. They are generated by transforming the title or main content of the resource into a URL-friendly format. This usually involves removing special characters, converting spaces to hyphens, and making the text lowercase.

Benefits of using slugs include:

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Descriptive slugs can contribute to better search engine ranking, as search engines often consider keywords in URLs when determining the relevance of a page to a search query.

User Experience: Slugs make URLs more readable and memorable for users, improving the overall user experience and making it easier to share links.

Navigation: A well-structured slug can give users an idea of what to expect on the page before they click on the link.

When creating slugs, it's important to ensure that they are unique within your website to avoid conflicts and confusion. Additionally, you should handle special characters and diacritics appropriately to create valid and user-friendly URLs.

#### Http Methods and when to use them (GET, PUT,PATCH,POST, DELETE,OPTIONS).

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
HTTP methods (also known as HTTP verbs) are fundamental concepts in the HTTP protocol, used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. Each HTTP method has a specific purpose and use case. Here's an overview of commonly used HTTP methods and when to use them:

**GET:**

- Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.
- Use Cases: Use GET to fetch a resource's representation. It should be safe (no side effects) and idempotent (repeated requests have the same effect as a single request).
- Example: Fetching a blog post, retrieving user profile information.

**POST:**

- Purpose: Submit data to the server for processing.
- Use Cases: Use POST to send data to the server to create a new resource or perform a non-idempotent action that might have side effects.
- Example: Creating a new user account, submitting a form, adding a comment.

**PUT:**

- Purpose: Update or create a resource on the server.
- Use Cases: Use PUT to update an existing resource or create a new one if it doesn't exist. It should be idempotent (repeated requests don't have unintended side effects).
- Example: Updating a user's profile, updating a blog post.

**PATCH:**

- Purpose: Partially update a resource on the server.
- Use Cases: Use PATCH to apply partial modifications to a resource. It is used when you want to update specific fields of a resource without affecting the rest of the data.
- Example: Updating only the description of a blog post, modifying certain properties of an object.

**DELETE:**

- Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.
- Use Cases: Use DELETE to delete a resource from the server. It should be idempotent and safe if possible (although deletion is inherently not safe).
- Example: Deleting a user account, removing a comment.

**OPTIONS:**

- Purpose: Retrieve information about the communication options for the target resource.
- Use Cases: Use OPTIONS to request information about the communication options supported by the server for a specific resource.
- Example: Checking supported HTTP methods, CORS preflight requests.

#### What are the HTTP Codes

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

**GET:**

- 200 OK: The request was successful, and the response body contains the requested data.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found on the server.

**POST:**

- 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created on the server.
- 400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request, often due to invalid parameters.

**PUT:**

- 200 OK: The request was successful, and the resource was updated.
- 204 No Content: The request was successful, and the response body is empty (no data to send back).

**PATCH:**

- 200 OK: The request was successful, and the resource was partially updated.
- 204 No Content: The request was successful, and the response body is empty (no data to send back).

**DELETE:**

- 204 No Content: The resource was successfully deleted, and the response body is empty.
- 404 Not Found: The resource to be deleted was not found on the server.

**OPTIONS:**

- 200 OK: The server successfully responded to an OPTIONS request, providing information about allowed communication options for the target resource.

Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)

#### What is difference between Session Storage, Local Storage and Cookies

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

Session storage, cookies, and localStorage are all techniques for storing data in web applications on the client-side, but they differ in terms of capacity, persistence, and usage. Let's explore each of them in more detail:

**Session Storage:**

- sessionStorage is a client-side storage mechanism available in modern web browsers.
- Data stored in sessionStorage is specific to a particular browser tab or window and is available only for the duration of that session (until the tab or window is closed).
- It provides a simple key-value storage mechanism similar to JavaScript objects.
  sessionStorage is often used to store temporary data that needs to be accessible within a single browsing session, such as form data or state information.
- Data stored in sessionStorage does not persist across different sessions or browser tabs/windows.

**Cookies:**

- Cookies are small pieces of data that a web server can store on the user's device (client-side).
- Cookies are sent back and forth between the client and the server with each HTTP request and response.
- They can be used for various purposes, such as user authentication, tracking user behavior, and maintaining session state.
- Cookies have an expiration time, which can be set to make them persistent (stored even after the browser is closed) or session-based (deleted when the browser is closed).
- Cookies are subject to size limitations (usually around 4KB per cookie) and are often used for storing small amounts of data.

**localStorage:**

- localStorage is another client-side storage mechanism available in modern web browsers.
- It provides a larger storage space (usually around 5-10 MB) compared to cookies or sessionStorage.
- Data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- Like sessionStorage, localStorage also uses a simple key-value storage model.
- localStorage is often used for storing larger amounts of data, caching resources, or maintaining application state across different sessions.

In summary, sessionStorage and localStorage are client-side storage options that provide a way to store data in a user's browser. sessionStorage is temporary and tied to a single session, while localStorage is more persistent and lasts beyond a session. Cookies, on the other hand, are small pieces of data that are sent between the client and server with each request and are often used for various purposes, including tracking and authentication. The choice of which mechanism to use depends on factors such as data size, persistence requirements, and the specific use case of your web application.

Local Storage – The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) – reducing the amount of traffic between client and server. It will stay until it is manually cleared through settings or program.

Session Storage – It is similar to local storage; the only difference is while data stored in local storage has no expiration time, data stored in session storage gets cleared when the page session ends. Session Storage will leave when the browser is closed.
