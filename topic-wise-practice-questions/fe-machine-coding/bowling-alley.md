# Bowling Alley

### Write machine code for a single-lane bowling alley system.

One bowling game will be played by multiple players on a single lane.  
During the game, players and their scores will be maintained and shown by the system and the winner will be declared at the end of the game.

Some rules about bowling:

- The Game of bowling consists of 5 Rounds.
- Each round consists of alternate plays (one by each player), and each player will have two chances to drop all the “pins”
- The score for a round is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for **strikes** and **spares**.
- A **strike** is when the player knocks down all ten pins on the first try. If there is a strike the player gets 10 bonus points.
- A **spare** is when the player knocks down all ten pins in two tries. If there is spare the player gets 5 bonus points.
- In the final round, a player who rolls a **spare** or a **strike** is allowed to roll extra 2 balls(not rounds) to complete the round. This allows for a potential of 7 strikes (5+2) in a single game.
- **Strike** is denoted by **‘x’** and **spare** is denoted by ‘/’. All other pin drop count can be denoted by 0 - 9 (for ex: 5, if five pins were dropped in a round)
- After the final round, display the Player list in ranked order on the basis of score.

### Bonus Point: (Only Attempt If Time Permits)

**Changing Bonus Rule:** Bonus points are awarded, depending on what is scored in the next 2 balls (for a strike) or next 1 ball (for a spare).

_Input:_

- No. of players
- Score Input can be taken from fileInput or console.

_Output:_

Enter Score for Player2 - Chance1: 3
Enter Score for Player2 - Chance2: 4
*********************************************************
Player2 Score Chance1 - 3pins Chance2 - 4pin                *********************************************************

_Example for bonus question:_

```
Strike:
    Round 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
    Round 2, ball 1: 3 pins
    Round 2, ball 2: 6 pins
    The total score from these throws is:
    Round one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19
    Round two: 3 + 6 = 9
    TOTAL = 28

Spare:
    Round 1, ball 1: 7 pins
    Round 1, ball 2: 3 pins (spare)
    Round 2, ball 1: 4 pins
    Round 2, ball 2: 2 pins

The total score from these throws is:
    Round one: 7 + 3 + 4 (bonus) = 14
    Round two: 4 + 2 = 6
    TOTAL = 20

```
