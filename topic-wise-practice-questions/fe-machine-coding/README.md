## Sample Questions

1. Create a website for student records with client-side search, sort & pagination. 
Implement your own design, and make sure to use this endpoint for the data https://api.abcxyz.com. 
Bonus points for good design, optimized search (throttle, debounce), and modular code. No frameworks allowed, use Vanilla JS.

2. Create a rideshare website where users can request other users for sharing their rides. 
Use https://api.abcxyz.com?startTime=xx&startLocation=yy&endLocation for the list of active rides, start and end time, and 
owner details where startTime, startLocation & endLocation is provided by the user searching for rides. Stack – VanillaJS.

3. Develop a Carousel module with previous, next buttons, autoplay option, and freeze the carousel if hovered. 
Make sure all the values are configurable and passed externally. Use plain javascript to implement this.

4. Create a web app where users can see the free meeting rooms in the office. Input – start time, end time, floor. 
Suggest free slots & time modifications in case rooms are not free. Use React and Redux. 
Endpoint – https://api.abcxyz.com. Use GraphQl queries during API calls.
