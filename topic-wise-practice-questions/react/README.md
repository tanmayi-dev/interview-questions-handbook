## Questions <a id="questions"></a>

- Explain Rules of React
- What is Virtual DOM ? and why is it used ?
- Explain how React code acutlaly results in visual changes on the user's browser in as much detail as possible
- How does React's Virtual DOM work, and what are its advantages over the real DOM ?
- What is critical rendering path ?
- Virtual DOM and Reconciliation Basics - [faq internals](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)
  - When is the component remounted (when is state reset) ? [preserving and resetting state](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state)
  - [Coding Task : Nested component vs render function](./coding-tasks/nested-component-vs-render-function/README.md)
    - Describe differences between `ComponentA` and `ComponentB`
    - Are there any violations of React Rules ? What are the consequences ? 
- What's the difference between `reflow` and `repaint`?
  - `reflow`
    - changes structure or layout of the page
    - changes to width, height, position, DOM changes
    - more expensive compared to repaint
    - width, height, margin, display
  - `repaint` happens when
    - changes visual appearance without affecting layout
    - changes to color, background, visibility
    - less expensive, but frequent repaints can degrade performance
    - color, background-color, visibility, border-color

- Explain rules of React Hooks ?
- Name Reack hooks you know
- What are hooks ? How do they improve functional component functionality ?
- Present candidate with a useState with extensive computation inside. Ask to resolve the issue
  - `useMemo` should be used to resolve it
- Can you wrap a hook in `if` statement ? Why not ?
- What are custom hooks ? What would you use them for ?
- Write a custom hook. Explain its lifecycle
- Create custom hook that uses async await in useEffect 
- What is a pure function and how does it relate to React ?
- Use hooks to load data and render them

  - How do you decide when to use `useMemo` ?
  - Can `useMemo` be used to skip re-renders of a child component ? What are the use cases and requirements ?
- `useCallback` - [ref](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback)
  - Why use it ? What exactly is achieved by memoizing a callback ?

- What is a Fragment ?
- What ARIA attribute do you know ? What do they do ?
- What is one-way binding and two-way binding ?

- How can you optimize React performance using code splitting ?
- Explain the role of keys in React lists and why are they essential
