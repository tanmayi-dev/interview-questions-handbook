## Pokemon App

- Pokemon App
  - Left side : list of pokemons
  - Right side : Detail of a pokemon
  - When you click on pokemon list item, it will open some detail
  - All will be working inside of a memory, no router,  no url change, after refresh the state is lost
  - Code can also break some best practices and ask them to address those
    - Like multiple components in one file, wrong names, and other weird stuff
- Tasks
  - Fix problems with fetching
    - Just throw some random problem with asynchronous stuff
  - Fix problems with Types
    - we can throw some randome ANYs somewhere and let them address it
  - Make sure that Pokemon detail is "shareable"
    - Basically the state is stored in URL
    - Here we can also ask them to do some error message if the parameter is not valid or is not from the list of pokemons
